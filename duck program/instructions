the program is untested (sorry i made it during class at school lol)

it currenntly looks for the images in "d:/Pictures/"
if you dont have a drive with the letter "d" easiest way would be to lable a usb drive as "d" 
and put the duck gif frames that are included in there under a folder called "pictures"
run it with duckrun.bat which should be run from the same directory as all the other .bat files.
if you want to change the images have fun it took me a hour or two just to set 170 images for the 8.5 second 20fps duck gif
